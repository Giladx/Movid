# About
###################################################

Movid is an acronym for Modular Open Vision Interaction Daemon. 
Movid a crossplatform and Open Source tracker, designed to be as modular as possible.

For more information see: http://www.movid.org

# Features
###################################################

* Crossplatform
Movid is fully cross-platform. It runs on Windows, Linux, MacOSX and FreeBSD. You can share and use the same "pipeline presets" for every platform. 

* Daemon
As the acronym suggests, Movid runs as a daemon process. That means you can launch it on a headless computer if you want. 

* Threading
With Movid, you have the ability to enable threading for any module you want. That means you are finally able to use your Core 2 Duo / Quad Core to its full potential. :) Obviously, you can still use non-threaded mode if all you got is a single-core processor. 

*Remote API
Movid has a JSON remote API to control all the settings and adjust your pipeline in real time! 

*HTML5 Administration
Movid Web administration makes use of the most recent developments in web programming with open standards like HTML5. No heavy flash or Java required, although one sure could create a frontend using those platforms. All that is required is a compatible HTML5 web browser. As of today, Firefox 3.6, Safari and Chromium have successfully run Movid Web Administration.

# Compiling Movid
###################################################

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Linux Compile Notes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following instructions are for Ubuntu/Debian.
They should be easily transferable to other linux distributions.
Building from source on these distributions is really easy.

First, you have to install the opencv headers, git and the build-tools:
sudo apt-get install libcv-dev libcvaux-dev libhighgui-dev git-core build-essential

Then, you get the current development version of Movid:
git clone git://github.com/tito/Movid.git

Afterwards, we change to the Movid repo you just cloned:
cd Movid

It is time to compile, let's run make!
make

Now you should be able to use movid already. Try the simple-video preset:
./movid -l presets/simple-video.txt

Now that the daemon is running, you can simply open your webbrowser
(needs to be Firefox 3.6 or some other browser with HTML5 and support for
the canvas object. Javascript has to be enabled.) and navigate to the admin interface:
http://127.0.0.1:7500/

+ Windows Compile Notes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There is a visual studio solution in the Movid.visualstudio folder.

Before you can open it and compile without errors, you need to install OpenCV.  You can compile openCV 2.0 yourself.  The official binary distribution will not work because teh libs and dlls are build with mingw, dont work with visual studio, and dont include the blob tracking stuff in cvaux.

If you dont want to compiel yourself, do teh following:

*download http://tehansen.de/OpenCV.zip
*unzip to C:\OpenCV  

it must go in C:\OpenCV, otherwise you need to change the library include directory in teh Movid Visual Studio project, also teh VS studio set teh PATH environment variable to include c:\OpenCV\bin.  If you dont know what this paragraph is talking about, just make sure you unzip it into C:\OpenCV, so that the dll files are in C:\OpenCV\bin, and the lib files in C:\OpenCV\lib

+ OSX Compile Notes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You will need OpenCV to build movid. To learn how to best
install OpenCV, please refer to the according section below.

Movid comes with an XCode project that you can just open & build.
Note, however, that this project file is NOT guaranteed to be always
up to date.
We therefore recommend that you use the actual Makefile on the console
(which is also used by XCode) which we always keep updated.


==================================================
To build OpenCV on OSX:
==================================================

On OSX, you must build OpenCV before building Movid.
To do this, simply download and compile it using your
favorite tool or do it yourself.
We *strongly* suggest you use homebrew for this.
See http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ for more details.
After you have installed homebrew, simply type this at
the command prompt:
	brew install opencv

Depending on your configuration, this maybe has to be
run as root with `sudo` before the command.

If OpenCV installed properly, you can proceed with the
compilation of Movid as usual.




That's it! You can now play with Movid! If you have questions, feature requests, find bugs or want to help, please see the following page: http://movid.org/Documentation/HowToContribute
